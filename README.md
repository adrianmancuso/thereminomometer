## Theremin / Accelerometer / Duck Spinner

A short front-end project based on HTML5's ability to access accellator data and the Javascript _Web Audio API_.  Each direction is mapped to an oscillator and z-axis / rotation is mapped to a low-pass filter. iPhone users might have to _tap_ the duck to enable sound first. Watch your sound levels, it can get pretty hectic. Try it out here: [DUCK THEREMINOMETER](https://adrianmancuso.github.io/thereminomometer/)
